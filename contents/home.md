I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Hunan University. I received my Ph.D. from the College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering of Hunan University in 2025. My research interests mainly include autonomous driving perception, 3D scene perception, and semantic scene completion, robots. Served as reviewer for many top journals and conferences such as TCSVT, TII, TMM, ICLR, AAAI, NeurIPS, and ICASSP.
